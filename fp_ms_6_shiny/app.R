                                                       that not all players make the same amount in a year, I realized that fixed fines would have 
                                                       different effects on different players and hurts them disproportionately (based on salary).
                                                       However, smaller fines on technical fouls, which are very subjective and not always just,
                                                       account for many of the fines, and those should obviously remain a negligible. But there are still

                                                       and fines? Is the correlation more relevant when working with minutes instead? Do players have
                                                       behavior changes and increase in fines when they receive new contracts/salary increases? These

for them- and have been able to look at fines data for the past two years. I 
got the data for NBA salaries from basketball-reference.com and ESPN and am 
able to look at past player salaries starting in 1999-2000 too. I ran regressions on different comparisons of variables

                                    p("From what can be seen, it is clear that the higher-earning players
                                      tend to have higher incidences of getting fined. However, that does 
                                      not translate to them being fined a higher amount in total which indicates
                                      that changing the amount of the fines might not make a difference as there
                                      is no correlation between amount fined and salaries. Of course, this might
                                      be because the higher paid players are more high profile, so they have 
                                      higher amounts of technicals (which are $2k each) while other players have
                                      higher fine amounts with less occurrences due to different infractions
                                      (e.g. suspensions). However, the trend is the same for minutes as well. We
                                      see players with higher minute totals have higher fine incidences while there
                                      is no correlation between total amount of fines and total minutes played in 
                                      a season. Of course, the minutes data is limited as I could only sample the
                                      top 100 players with the highest minute totals. However, I would like to 
                                      expand on this by figuring out the relationship between minutes and salaries
                                      to see if one is a compounding variable or that they are highly independent. 
                                      Overall though, it does not seem like a change in NBA fine policy is needed 
                                      or would cause a positive effect as ultimately we do not see a league-wide
                                      inequitable distribution of total fine amounts for players, and there is 
                                      a lot of evidence tying fine incidences more to minutes than to salaries 
                                      which makes sense as players are more likely to commit an infraction the
                                      more they play (and the high-minute players tend to be higher-paid ones
                                      too."))))))
