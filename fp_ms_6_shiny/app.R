                                                       However, smaller fines on technical fouls, which are very subjective and not always just,
                                                       account for many of the fines, and those should obviously remain a negligible. But there are still

                                                       and fines? Is the correlation more relevant when working with minutes instead? Do players have
                                                       behavior changes and increase in fines when they receive new contracts/salary increases? These

for them- and have been able to look at fines data for the past two years. I 
got the data for NBA salaries from basketball-reference.com and ESPN and am 
able to look at past player salaries starting in 1999-2000 too. I ran regressions on different comparisons of variables
